                        This is a simple C++ calculator. I made this when
                        I was only in my computer science I class. To give 
                        you an idea how early this is, it is my first year 
                        being introduced to computer science ever, and
                        I had made an application. In case you need to know,
                        my computer science I class taught C++ as the language.
                        The name of this application is named CLR, but do not
                        be afraid of the file because of its name.

                        Again this was made when I was only in computer science I.
                        This application is just another version of Notepad, except with
                        a different design and decorations. I chose C# because you can
                        make Windows Form Applications with them, and it is more common
                        to code that in C#, though C++ is possible as a language for that 
                        type of thing. Again, do not be afraid of this application once
                        you see the name of it.

                        This was made during when I was in my second computer science class,
                        Computer Science AP. My friend Sahib Chandnani (who currently goes to
                        University of Texas at Austin) had recommended me to build an android app
                        in order to create something with my knowledge and skills. With enough time,
                        I was able to make this application in 5 days, spending about 6 hours per day.
                        I still am very proud of this project because I had gained a lot of knowledge
                        about making mobile apps and this app turned out to be very great.

                Download and try to beat my TICTACTOE AI</a>

                    <li>
                        I made this during the summer after my second year in computer science
                        when I wanted to learn more about AI with games. I decided to
                        choose tictactoe because it is a very simple game. It is unbeatable, and
                        I have had other people try to beat it, but they ended up tying, or sometimes 
                        even losing! When you open the file, there should be weirdly named folder
                        (it only helps me make it stand out even more), and in that folder
                        there will be the .html, .css, and .js files. Open the html file on your
                        main browser, and you should be able to play against the AI.
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <div class="down 5">
            <a href="downloads/CHESS AI.zip">
                Download and try to beat my CHESS AI</a>
            <text>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>
                        This took a very long time. It took time to get used to the chess.js
                        library. However, eventually I got the hang of it. I am not that good
                        at chess, so this AI can beat me easily. I would say that if you are
                        a decent chess player, that you can possible beat this. However, for the
                        beginner like me, it is unlikely. There is also an option to make the AI
                        versus itself. If you are able to change script.js file, there is
                        at the last line where if you get rid of the comment to that function call,
                        you are able to make the AI play against itself. Now, I am not sure if
                        this is for any reason, but whenever the AI plays against itself, it runs
                        faster than when a human plays against it. That is weird. Again, just test it
                        by opening the .html file onto your browser. When you play against it,
                        depending on your computer speed, be patient. It it looks like it froze,
                        keep waiting, its just doing more calculations.
