            <strong>Basic Introduction about me</strong>
            <p>
                
                Hi! My name is Jason Siu, and I am currently a student
                 attending Stephen F. Austin High School. I am always
                 working on something computer science related, whether
                 it's building an AI in Javascript, making an android app in Java,
                 or building neural networks from scratch in Python! I am 
                 a 100% self learner when it comes to these topics, and I am
                 always acceptant and ready to learn more, no matter how
                 hard a task or concept may seem!                             
                                               
            </p>

            <strong>  &emsp; My Past and Current Hobbies</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            My hobbies currently are programming (most notably 
            seen through my personal projects) and exercising.
                On the occaisional basis,
            I think of very difficult math questions for myself that
             I initially can't think of
            an answer to. However, with time, I always solve those questions
            with deep understanding, and I end up learning something new 
            in the long run. In the past I loved solving Rubik's Cubes.
            I used to love it so much that I made a YouTube channel
            dedicated to teaching others about it. I have done this hobby for about
            two years. My fastest time ever was 9.53 seconds. However, that solve
            was a a very lucky one. You can view my very old videos
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwxklScPJ2zayEJJvmH26lw">here.</a>
            You'll notice when you watch some of my videos that I used to make basic
            2d and 3d animations!

            <strong>I am very skilled in: </strong>
            <br />
            <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
            I am very open to thinking and approaching problems in more than
            one way, whether the answer requires creative thinking or more 
            of a methodical approach. I always think to myself that knowing
            only one way to do things isn't good enough, but knowing more ways makes
            myself a more flexible thinker.
            <br />
            <h1>Willingness to Learn</h1>
            Learning is very personal to me. I always enjoy knowing things
            no matter the practicality. From my point of view, learning
            is a way to improve yourself, and become better than you previously
            were. I always aim to be the best that I can, and so learning new
            things is a daily occurence in my life.

            <strong>I would describe myself as: </strong>
            <br />
            <h1>Independent</h1>
            I primarily to my own things by myself. However, if someone asks
            for help, and wants to work with me, I am able to do so willingly.
            However, most of my general learning has came from myself, and all of my 
            coding projects have been done independently. 
            <h1>Hardworking</h1>
            I work continuously on a project or any problem for many consecutive hours
             if needed. If i don't understand something, I will try my hardest to understand it,
             and grasp a good intuition about such thing. Whatever is in my highest priority, I
             will do and eventually, even if it may take many days, complete.
